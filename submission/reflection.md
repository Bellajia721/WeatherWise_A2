# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?
ChatGpt, Copilot.
It helped me understand why certain functions or errors behaved as they did—for example, explaining the cause of an ImportError in ipywidgets, or clarifying why my API returned only three days of weather data.

## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?
I intentionally used several prompting strategies throughout the development process. Such as, exploratory prompting, to investigate system-level issues (e.g., API limits, module behavior); decomposition prompting, breaking complex UI logic into smaller, testable functions; reflective prompting – asking the AI to explain reasoning behind a suggestion, not just what to change.

## What Worked Well?
Describe one thing you’re proud of.
I am proud of how I managed to integrate multiple system components — natural language processing, AI-generated forecasting, and interactive widgets — into one coherent weather application. The AI-assisted discussions helped me realize that understanding why something doesn’t work is often more valuable than instantly fixing it. By the end, I could independently trace data flow between UI input, weather API responses, and AI forecast outputs.

## What Would You Do Differently?
Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.
If I had more time, I would focus on automated testing and modularization. For example, I would create unit tests for functions like ai_extend_forecast() and generate_weather_response() to ensure future changes don’t break functionality. I would also experiment with clearer error handling and visual feedback in the UI to enhance user experience. Additionally, I would explore integrating multiple data sources to compare the reliability of different APIs.

## Final Thoughts
Any parting comments on your learning experience?
This project has shown me how AI can act as a learning collaborator, not a code generator. By interacting with ChatGPT, I learned to ask more precise and meaningful questions—especially those that encourage reasoning and reflection rather than direct solutions. Through this, I strengthened my problem-solving mindset, learned how to communicate with AI effectively, and developed a deeper understanding of how modern tools can support continuous learning in programming.
