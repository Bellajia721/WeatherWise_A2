Me: There is an error saying: “ImportError: cannot import name ‘Tabs’ from ‘ipywidgets’ (/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/ipywidgets/init.py)”. Why does this happen?

AI: That error:

ImportError: cannot import name 'Tabs' from 'ipywidgets'

means the version of ipywidgets you have installed no longer exposes Tabs at the top level.
Here’s what’s going on and how to fix it 👇

⸻

🧩 Why it happens
	•	In older versions (≤ 7.x), Tabs was imported directly:

from ipywidgets import Tabs


	•	In newer versions (≥ 8.x), the internal API changed — Tabs is now implemented as
ipywidgets.Tab (singular), not Tabs.
There’s no symbol called Tabs anymore, so importing it triggers that ImportError.

This often happens when:
	•	your notebook / Colab / JupyterLab upgraded ipywidgets automatically, or
	•	you’re using sample code written for ipywidgets 7 while your environment runs 8.

⸻

✅ How to fix it

Option 1: Update the code (preferred)

Replace:

from ipywidgets import Tabs
tabs = Tabs(children=[w1, w2])

with:

from ipywidgets import Tab
tabs = Tab(children=[w1, w2])

The class is now Tab, not Tabs.

⸻

Option 2: Match the old version

If the code must stay unchanged (e.g., grading script, legacy notebook):

pip install ipywidgets==7.7.1

then restart the kernel.

⸻

🧠 How to confirm which version you’re running

In a notebook cell:

import ipywidgets
print(ipywidgets.__version__)

	•	8.x → use Tab
	•	7.x → Tabs still exists

⸻

🧾 Summary

Cause	Fix
API rename in ipywidgets 8	Use Tab instead of Tabs
Old code requires v7 syntax	pip install ipywidgets==7.7.1
Unsure	Check ipywidgets.__version__

If you show me the import section of your script, I can tell you exactly which lines need changing.
